# Analysing_The_Discourse_Related_To_Electrical_Vehicles_On_Social_Media

This is my Final Year Project at Cardiff University (Dissertation). 

In this project, Natural Language Processing techniques such as Sentiment Analysis 
and LDA Topic Modeling had been used, in order to analyse the sentiment that people 
have and the topics that are being discussed on Twitter regarding electric vehicles. 
The results showed that the positive sentiment of people was higher than the negative. 
Some of the major findings indicate that sustainability may be one of the main reasons 
why people support the transition to EVs, and that mining for EV battery materials and 
charging stations challenges might be some of the main factors that hold people back from 
buying an EV. Additionally, it has been observed that real-time events might have also 
affected peopleâ€™s sentiment towards EVs.
